StockPilotDev: The Chef-Analyst Strategy Suite
Overview
StockPilotDev is a high-performance data analysis suite designed specifically for small business restaurant owners. Most data tools are built by engineers who have never worked a double on a Friday night. StockPilotDev is different. Built by a chef with 17 years of operational experience, this tool bridges the gap between raw POS data and real-world kitchen results.

Core Pillars
📈 Sales Intelligence: Tracks Revenue, Gross Profit, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to identify your most loyal "VIP" guests.

👥 Labor Productivity: Uses "Leak Detection" to pinpoint the exact hours where labor spend exceeds revenue.

📦 Inventory Command: Real-time stock tracking with automated reorder alerts to prevent 86'd items.

The Chef-Analyst Advantage
Unlike standard generic data tools, StockPilotDev focuses on Contextual Analysis. It doesn't just show a high labor cost; it identifies "yield and trim" prep opportunities and identifies specific "Leak Windows" (like the critical 4 PM prep-to-service transition) where profit is often lost.
